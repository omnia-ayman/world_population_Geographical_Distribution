# world_population
 know more about world population over the continents and different countries
 # about the project
 programs used:
 _Kaggle for dataset
 _goggle BiqQuery cloud using sql for cleaning data
 _tableau for visualization 
 note: queries mensioned here are the same in world population final project.sql file

 # overview 
 In this program, we try to answer some questions related to the population size in each continent and country, about population density and population growth, and to understand the relationship between population density, area, and population number. We hope that we have covered the main questions in this project.
 # 1-Big comtinents in population IN 2000s
 from the query showed in google big query here
 <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=648510427605:01caa1317aae416b97ae8fa8c95289c6">
 we can find that Asia is the maximum continent in population from 2000 to 2022 and the second is Africa. May Asia got the first place because of the big area and many many countries! so let us jump to the next question.
 <br>
  
 # 2- How does area affects the number of population 
 using the query here:

 # 4- population increasing rate 
 in this query I have discussed this question
 <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=648510427605:a67c07b9b01341abaad48e32aa0da929">
 we can discover that the average is increasing in a line way (showing in the dashboard) and that shows how is the world facing a huge amount of population increasing
 <br>
 # 5- Max and Min countries in growth rate
 max query here: <a href = "https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=648510427605:6b1cda29d070412c98b0b8a00a91c697">
 <br>
 min query here: <a href = "https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=648510427605:26878b7dcf9e4f4a8fbd354bfa27d2de">
 <br>
 maximum 3 countries in growth rate were MOLDOFA , POLAND, NIGER recording 1.069, 1.04,1.037 Respectively
 <br>
 on the other hand the min 3 countries were UKRAINE, LEBANON , AMERICAN SAMOA recording 0.912 , 0.9816 , 0.9831 Respectively
