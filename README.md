 # overview 
 In this program, we try to answer some questions related to the population size in each continent and country, about population density and population growth, and to understand the relationship between population density, area, and population number. We hope that we have covered the main questions in this project.
 # 1-Big comtinents in population IN 2000s
 we can find that Asia is the maximum continent in population from 2000 to 2022 and the second is Africa. May Asia got the first place because of the big area and many many countries! so let us jump to the next question.
 <br>
  
 # 2- How does area affects the number of population 
 BY visualization .. discover that asia is the most 2022 population and the max area found there ,the second is africa and the third is north america which highlight the big relation between area and population founded  

 # 4- population increasing rate 

 we can discover that the average is increasing in a line way (showing in the dashboard) and that shows how is the world facing a huge amount of population increasing
 <br>
 # 5- Max and Min countries in growth rate
 <br>
 maximum 3 countries in growth rate were MOLDOFA , POLAND, NIGER recording 1.069, 1.04,1.037 Respectively
 <br>
 on the other hand the min 3 countries were UKRAINE, LEBANON , AMERICAN SAMOA recording 0.912 , 0.9816 , 0.9831 Respectively
